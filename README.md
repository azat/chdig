#### archlinux user repository (aur)

And also for archlinux there is an aur package:
- [**chdig-latest-bin**](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/chdig-latest-bin) - binary artifact of the upstream
- [chdig-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/chdig-git) - build from sources
- [chdig-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/chdig-bin) - binary of the latest stable version

*Note: `chdig-latest-bin` is recommended because it is latest available version and you don't need toolchain to compile*

#### scoop (windows)

```
scoop bucket add extras
scoop install extras/chdig
```

#### brew (macos)

```

*And also see [releases](https://github.com/azat/chdig/releases) as well.*

### Demo

[![asciicast](https://github.com/azat/chdig/releases/download/v0.5.0/chdig-v0.5.0.gif)](https://asciinema.org/a/627298)

### Motivation

The idea is came from everyday digging into various ClickHouse issues.

ClickHouse has a approximately universe of introspection tools, and it is easy
to forget some of them. At first I came with some
[slides](https://azat.sh/presentations/2022-know-your-clickhouse/) and a
picture (to attract your attention) by analogy to what [Brendan
Gregg](https://www.brendangregg.com/linuxperf.html) did for Linux:

[![Know Your ClickHouse](https://azat.sh/presentations/2022-know-your-clickhouse/Know-Your-ClickHouse.png)](https://azat.sh/presentations/2022-know-your-clickhouse/)

*Note, the picture and the presentation had been made in the beginning of 2022,
so it may not include some new introspection tools*.

But this requires you to dig into lots of places, and even though during this
process you will learn a lot, it does not solves the problem of forgetfulness.
So I came up with this simple TUI interface that tries to make this process
simpler.

`chdig` can be used not only to debug some problems, but also just as a regular
introspection, like `top` for Linux.

### Features

- `top` like interface (or [`csysdig`](https://github.com/draios/sysdig) to be more precise)
- [Flamegraphs](https://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html) (CPU/Real/Memory)
- Cluster support (`--cluster`)

### Views

- Query view (`system.processes`)
- Slow query log (`system.query_log`)
- Last queries (`system.query_log`)
- Processors (`system.processors_profile_log`)
- Views (`system.query_views_log`)
- Query logs (`system.text_log`)
- Server logs (`system.text_log`)
- Merges view (`system.merges`)
- Mutations view (`system.mutations`)
- Replicas (`system.replicas`)
- Replication queue view (`system.replication_queue`)
- Fetches (`system.replicated_fetches`)
- Backups (`system.backups`)
- Errors (`system.errors`)

And there is a huge bunch of [TODOs](TODO.md#checklist) (right now it is too
huge to include it here).

**Note, this it is in a pre-alpha stage, so everything can be changed (keyboard
shortcuts, views, color schema and of course features)**

### Requirements

If something does not work, like you have too old version of ClickHouse, consider upgrading.

Later some backward compatiblity will be added as well.

*Note: the oldest version that had been tested was 21.2*

### Build from sources

Prerequisites:
- [`cargo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/)
- [`nfpm`](https://github.com/goreleaser/nfpm)

```
# will build deb/rpm/archlinux packages

### Notes

Since Rust is a new language to me, the code can be far from ideal.
