### What is format of the URL accepted by `chdig`?

The simplest form is just - **`localhost`**

For a secure connections with user and password _(note: passing the password on
the command line is not safe)_, use:

```sh
chdig -u 'user:password@clickhouse-host.com/?secure=true'
```

A full list of supported connection options is available [here](https://github.com/azat-rust/clickhouse-rs/?tab=readme-ov-file#dns).

_Note: This link currently points to my fork, as some changes have not yet been accepted upstream._

### Environment variables

A safer way to pass the password is via environment variables:


```sh
export CLICKHOUSE_USER='user'
export CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD='password'
chdig -u 'clickhouse-host.com/?secure=true'
# or specify the port explicitly
chdig -u 'clickhouse-host.com:9440/?secure=true'
```

### What is --config (`CLICKHOUSE_CONFIG`)?

This is standard config for [ClickHouse client](https://clickhouse.com/docs/interfaces/cli#configuration_files), i.e.

```yaml
user: foo
password: bar
host: play
secure: true
```

_See also some examples and possible advanced use cases [here](/tests/configs)_

### What is --connection?

`--connection` allows you to use predefined connections, that is supported by
`clickhouse-client` ([1], [2]).

Here is an example in `XML` format:

```xml
<clickhouse>
    <connections_credentials>
        <connection>
            <name>prod</name>
            <hostname>prod</hostname>
            <user>default</user>
            <password>secret</password>
            <!-- <secure>false</secure> -->
            <!-- <skip_verify>false</skip_verify> -->
            <!-- <ca_certificate></ca_certificate> -->
            <!-- <client_certificate></client_certificate> -->
            <!-- <client_private_key></client_private_key> -->
        </connection>
    </connections_credentials>
</clickhouse>
```

Or in `YAML`:

```yaml
---
connections_credentials:
  prod:
    name: prod
    hostname: prod
    user: default
    password: secret
    # secure: false
    # skip_verify: false
    # ca_certificate:
    # client_certificate:
    # client_private_key:
```

And later, instead of specifying `--url` (with password in plain-text, which is
highly not recommended), you can use `chdig --connection prod`.

### Why I see IO wait reported as zero?

- You should ensure that ClickHouse uses one of taskstat gathering methods:
  - procfs
  - netlink

- And also for linux 5.14 you should enable `kernel.task_delayacct` sysctl as well.
